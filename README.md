Tableau Sales Dashboard Project

This repository hosts a comprehensive Tableau Sales Dashboard project designed to provide actionable insights into sales performance and trends. Leveraging Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities, the dashboard offers an intuitive interface for monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) and conducting in-depth trend analysis.

Key Features:

KPI Monitoring: The dashboard incorporates essential KPIs such as total sales, total profit, and total quantity, enabling stakeholders to track overall performance at a glance.
Trend Analysis: Through visually engaging charts and graphs, the dashboard presents detailed sales and profit trends over time, organized by week and category. This facilitates informed decision-making by highlighting patterns and identifying areas for improvement.
Year-over-Year Comparison: Utilizing calculated fields, the dashboard allows for comparisons between current and previous year sales, profit, and quantity. Percentage differences are also displayed, providing valuable insights into performance trends and growth metrics.
Enhanced Interactivity: Dynamic filters, created using parameters, enhance user interactivity by enabling real-time customization and exploration of data. This empowers users to drill down into specific segments and gain deeper insights tailored to their needs.
